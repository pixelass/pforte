## Why do I need this?

Pforte attempts to do what [next-auth](https://next-auth.js.org/) does, but is intended to be used
with [Vercel serverless functions](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/serverless-functions),
but should work with many other frameworks or setup, since it is framework-agnostic.

## How can I use this?

Please take a look at [the Vercel example](./examples/vercel)

## Why should I not use this in production

This library is currently a proof of concept and is potentially unsafe.
If you want to help improve the security or just want to review the code, we would be very happy
about your input.
