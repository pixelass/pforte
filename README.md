## Why do I need this?

Pforte attempts to do what [next-auth](https://next-auth.js.org/) does, but is fully
framework-agnostic.
The main purpose was better support for [Vercel serverless functions](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/serverless-functions),
but it should work with many other frameworks or setups (i.e. express.js).

## How can I use this?

> We are still improving the documentation.

Please check [the wiki](https://github.com/pixelass/pforte/wiki)

We added two simple examples:

- [Vercel example](./examples/vercel)
- [Express example](./examples/express)

## Why should I not use this in production?

This library is currently a proof of concept and is potentially unsafe.
If you want to help improve the security or just want to review the code, we would be very happy
about your input.
